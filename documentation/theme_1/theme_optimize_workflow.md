# Theme 1.0: Optimize Workflow

## Overview
Optimizing workflow within a team helps to effectively allocate resources on people, materials, and budget in an organization. It is important to utilize automation because it helps to reduce costs, increase workflow efficiency, and reduce errors. We want to finish the project on time and minimize waste as much as possible.

## Initiative(s)
* [Setup Automated Tests with CI/CD](initiative_1/initiative_automated_testing.md)
* [Utilize a Kanban Board (GitHub Projects).](initiative_2/initiative_kanban_board.md)

## Test Plan
Unit tests have to be implemented for each feature of the application. Once a few 
amount of unit tests are created, GitHub workflows have to be configured to implement CI/CD.
