# Theme 1.0: Optimize Workflow

## Overview
Optimizing workflow within a team helps to effectively allocate resources on people, materials, and budget in an organization. It is important to utilize automation because it helps to reduce costs, increase workflow efficiency, and reduce errors. We want to finish the project on time and minimize waste as much as possible.
