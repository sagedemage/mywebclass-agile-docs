# Theme 2.0: Effective Communication

## Overview
Companies want stakeholders to be informed about the status of the project. A project manager has to effectively communicate goals, and expectations to team members. Communication helps teams to adapt to changes that occur during the project life cycle. Good communication ensures that the team is able to complete the project on time and solve problems.
