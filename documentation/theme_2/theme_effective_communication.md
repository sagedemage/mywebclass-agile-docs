# Theme 2.0: Effective Communication

## Overview
Companies want stakeholders to be informed about the status of the project. A project manager has to effectively communicate goals, and expectations to team members. Communication helps teams to adapt to changes that occur during the project life cycle. Good communication ensures that the team is able to complete the project on time and solve problems.

## Initiative(s)
* [Utilize a Kanban Board (Project in GitHub)](initiative_1/initiative_kanban_board.md)
* [Utilize SCRUM meetings](initiative_2/initiative_scrum_meetings.md)

## Test Plan
Code reviews help improve the quality of the code. It can help catch logical errors, and bugs
before it reaches to production. Code reviews can also help ensure the coding style is consistent. Feedback from code reviews helps make team collaboration effective.
